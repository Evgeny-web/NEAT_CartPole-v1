# NEAT_CartPole-v1
 First use NEAT algoritm

This is my first introduction to genetic algorithms.
Here the solution of the problem "CartPole" from the gym library is implemented using the NEAT algorithm. The dependence of the target metric on the number of epochs is visualized, as well as the topology of the algorithm.
